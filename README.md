This challenge was designed to use our knowledge of MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack development to modify the starter code of a book search engine application to use GraphQL.

## Installation

This project uses Node.js v.16.18.0

To run the program:
1. Open the command line trerminal
2. Install the packages `npm i`
3. Run the program `npm run develop`

## Usage

The user can edit their text in the space provided as they see fit, and it will be saved to the database. When they reload, or close and reopen the app, the text from the databasse will appear in the editor.
